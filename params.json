{"name":"Cfcgi","body":"Welcome to the `cfcgi` project home page!\r\n\r\n# Project description\r\n\r\n`cfcgi` is a modern replacement for the reference FastCGI libraries.  It features a streaming/incremental parser for FastCGI records written in plain C, as well as a higher-level C++ API.  It provides the necessary infrastructure for implementing FastCGI support in both HTTP gateways (web servers) and application servers.\r\n\r\n## Features\r\n\r\n1. Tiny footprint!  Statically compile `cfcgi` into your gateway or application with minimal overhead.  At its minimum, `cfcgi` consists only of a very small C API.\r\n1. Streaming/incremental parser in C.  The parser is fully interruptible, and thus suitable for use with asynchronous I/O.  Just feed the parser data as it is received and let it tell you when it has data to process.\r\n1. High-level FastCGI application handlers in C++.  Don't want to fuss with all that \"complicated\" C interface?  Fine, just inherit from `fcgi::Responder`, `fcgi::Authorizer` or `fcgi::Filter` and create a FastCGI application handler in minutes.\r\n1. Full support for all FastCGI features, including authorizers and filters.  Add custom authorization without the fuss of writing a plug-in for your web server.\r\n1. Built-in FastCGI application drivers for popular environments.  Mix and match your application handlers with different I/O models and benchmark them.  See which one gives you the best performance for your specific application.\r\n\r\n# Getting started\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\nThe Doxygen API documentation will be pre-compiled and made available online shortly.\r\n\r\n## Checking out the code\r\n\r\nPop your favorite terminal, locate your favorite development folder (named `projects` here) and fetch the code and its  dependencies:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ cd projects\r\n$ git clone git@github.com:AndreLouisCaron/cfcgi.git\r\n$ cd cfcgi\r\n$ git submodule init\r\n$ git submodule update\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Compiling\r\n\r\n### UNIX-like systems\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ mkdir work && cd work\r\n$ cmake ..\r\n$ make\r\n$ make test\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Microsoft Windows\r\n\r\nIf you're used to the command line interface and a real text editor, you can build the software using NMake:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ mkdir work && cd work\r\n$ cmake -G \"NMake Makefiles\" ..\r\n$ nmake\r\n$ nmake /A test\r\n```\r\n\r\nAlternatively, if you prefer the Visual Studio IDE and/or want to use the interactive debugger, you can generate Visual Studio solutions instead:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ cmake -G \"Visual Studio 9 2008\" ..\r\n$ devenv\r\n```\r\n\r\nUse `\"Visual Studio 8 2005\"` or `\"Visual Studio 8 2005 Win64\"` for 32-bit and 64-bit builds using Visual Studio 2005.\r\n\r\n# License and terms of use\r\n\r\nUsing this software in open source as well as commercial (close-source) applications is subject to the following conditions.\r\n\r\n> Copyright (C) 2011-2012, Andre Caron (andre.l.caron@gmail.com)\r\n> All rights reserved.\r\n>\r\n> Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\r\n> of this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal\r\n> in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\r\n> to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\r\n> copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\r\n> furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\r\n>\r\n> The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in\r\n> all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\r\n>\r\n> THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\r\n> IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\r\n> FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
