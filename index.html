        <p>Welcome to the <code>cfcgi</code> project home page!</p>

<h1>Project description</h1>

<p><code>cfcgi</code> is a modern replacement for the reference FastCGI libraries.  It features a streaming/incremental parser for FastCGI records written in plain C, as well as a higher-level C++ API.  It provides the necessary infrastructure for implementing FastCGI support in both HTTP gateways (web servers) and application servers.</p>

<h2>Features</h2>

<ol>
<li>Tiny footprint!  Statically compile <code>cfcgi</code> into your gateway or application with minimal overhead.  At its minimum, <code>cfcgi</code> consists only of a very small C API.</li>
<li>Streaming/incremental parser in C.  The parser is fully interruptible, and thus suitable for use with asynchronous I/O.  Just feed the parser data as it is received and let it tell you when it has data to process.</li>
<li>High-level FastCGI application handlers in C++.  Don't want to fuss with all that "complicated" C interface?  Fine, just inherit from <code>fcgi::Responder</code>, <code>fcgi::Authorizer</code> or <code>fcgi::Filter</code> and create a FastCGI application handler in minutes.</li>
<li>Full support for all FastCGI features, including authorizers and filters.  Add custom authorization without the fuss of writing a plug-in for your web server.</li>
<li>Built-in FastCGI application drivers for popular environments.  Mix and match your application handlers with different I/O models and benchmark them.  See which one gives you the best performance for your specific application.</li>
</ol><h1>Getting started</h1>

<h2>Documentation</h2>

<p>The Doxygen API documentation will be pre-compiled and made available online shortly.</p>

<h2>Checking out the code</h2>

<p>Pop your favorite terminal, locate your favorite development folder (named <code>projects</code> here) and fetch the code and its  dependencies:</p>

<pre><code>$ cd projects
$ git clone git@github.com:AndreLouisCaron/cfcgi.git
$ cd cfcgi
$ git submodule init
$ git submodule update
</code></pre>

<h2>Compiling</h2>

<h3>UNIX-like systems</h3>

<pre><code>$ mkdir work &amp;&amp; cd work
$ cmake ..
$ make
$ make test
</code></pre>

<h3>Microsoft Windows</h3>

<p>If you're used to the command line interface and a real text editor, you can build the software using NMake:</p>

<pre><code>$ mkdir work &amp;&amp; cd work
$ cmake -G "NMake Makefiles" ..
$ nmake
$ nmake /A test
</code></pre>

<p>Alternatively, if you prefer the Visual Studio IDE and/or want to use the interactive debugger, you can generate Visual Studio solutions instead:</p>

<pre><code>$ cmake -G "Visual Studio 9 2008" ..
$ devenv
</code></pre>

<p>Use <code>"Visual Studio 8 2005"</code> or <code>"Visual Studio 8 2005 Win64"</code> for 32-bit and 64-bit builds using Visual Studio 2005.</p>
